### AI for Life Sciences Virtual Hackathon

The project involved two tasks focused on forecasting groundwater levels in Austria and global freshwater reserves using machine learning
models, while also analyzing the impact of exogenous variables. Drawing from knowledge gained in the AI Business School and the Time Series
Econometrics course during my university studies, as well as skills from the Miuul Data Science Bootcamp, I contributed significantly to the
project's success. For the first task, I developed an efficient data storage and processing system in Python to handle thousands of CSV datasets
collected from various measurement stations, enabling accurate forecasting of groundwater levels in Austria over a 2-year period. I also helped
optimize machine learning and deep learning models for improved performance. In the second task, I conducted a literature review on how to
extract groundwater levels from NASA's GRACE global water mass anomaly data, identified suitable datasets, and contributed to feature
engineering and model optimization. Our team placed 3rd out of 116 participants.
