### WiDS Datathon 2025
**Provided By:** Women in Data Science (WiDS), Cornell University, UC Santa Barbara, Ann S. Bowers Womenâ€™s Brain Health Initiative (WBHI), Child Mind Institute (Healthy Brain Network), Reproducible Brain Charts (RBC)<br>
**Achievements:** Ongoing participation<br>
**Position:** Data Scientist<br>
**Duration:** January 2025 â€“ Present

**About Project:** An international team is working to solve a challenge supporting the neurodivergent community. The task involves analyzing demographic, diagnostic, and functional MRI data to build a predictive model for diagnosing ADHD. The aim is to uncover brain regions associated with ADHD in relation to gender roles, which could contribute to improving personalized approaches to treatment and care.

### AI for Life Sciences Virtual Hackathon
**Provided By:** University of Vienna, Gradient Zero, Daiki, Exoscale, Manna Laaz, E-duProof<br>
**Achievements:** Placed 3rd<br>
**Position:** Data Scientist<br>
**Duration:** June 2024 â€“ October 2024

**About Project:** Freshwater is undoubtedly one of the most vital elements necessary for sustaining life, if not the most crucial. The aim of the project in this virtual hackathon, a challenge set by the University of Vienna, is to forecast groundwater levels and investigate the exogenous variables that significantly affect water level fluctuations. Throughout this challenge, machine learning techniques were optimized, and time series analysis was conducted through 2 tasks.

ðŸ’§Task 1: Forecasted groundwater levels in Austria over a 2-year period using data from 487 measurement stations, thousands of CSV files, and 11 variables categorized under groundwater, precipitation, water source, and surface water, achieving a 0.15 SMAPE score. Source code can be found [here](https://github.com/gizemoge/AI_4_Life_Sciences_Hackathon2_Task1).


ðŸ’§Task 2: Utilized NASAâ€™s GRACE data to extract groundwater information through data mining and conducted a 5-year forecast, testing the impact of exogenous variables. Source code can be found [here](https://github.com/dilaracankaya/AI_4_Life_Sciences_Hackathon2_Task2).

### Women in Datathon
**Provided By:** UP School, Bitexen<br>
**Achievements:** Placed 1st<br>
**Position:** Data Scientist<br>
**Duration:** April 2024

**About Project:** A machine learning prediction model was constructed to observe the impact of health status, labor force participation, gender roles, and political representation on wage inequality in the context of gender roles. Additionally, the influence of gender roles on job placement was investigated. The competition was hosted on Kaggle, and Python and Markdown Language were used to complete the project. Here is the [Kaggle Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/edacelikeloglu/1st-place-upschoolxbitexen-datathon-mar24).

### Churninator ðŸ¤–
**Provided By:** Miuul Data Scientist Bootcamp Final Project, Istanbul Kodluyor Project<br>
**Achievements:** Placed 2nd<br>
**Position:** Data Scientist<br>
**Duration:** February 2024 - May 2024

**About Project:** Istanbul Kodluyor is Turkey's first social impact bond, coordinated by the Ministry of Industry and Technology and implemented by the Istanbul Development Agency (Ä°STKA), with investment from Bridges Outcomes Partnerships. The training was provided by Enocta and managed by Tobeto. After completing preparatory courses in programming, software development, and data science with Enocta, participants gained membership in the Istanbul Kodluyor Project and access to Miuul's Data Scientist Bootcamp.

The bootcamp covered topics such as feature engineering, MS SQL, machine learning, and Python, including over five real-world projects. **The final project Churninator**, involved a team effort to develop a machine learning product predicting customer churn in a bank, achieving a 92% success rate. A Streamlit web app was created to showcase the product, featuring an interactive dashboard and using RFM analysis for customer segmentation.
